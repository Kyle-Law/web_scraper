# Web Scraper

> Ruby Capstone Project of Microverse, which students have to complete a real-world-like project within 72 hours.

It's a 3-in-1 Web Scraper, which allows users to parse all courses from udacity.com and jobs from indeed.com and remote.io.

### Run tests
1) Git clone this repo and cd the to the `web_scraper` directory.
2) Install rspec with `gem install rspec`
3) Run `rspec spec/scraper_rspec.rb`
4) You would see failures because all 3 scraped files haven't been created yet.
5) To solve it, run `ruby bin/main.rb` and input 'udacity', 'indeed', and 'remote.io' for every execution.
6) Run `rspec spec/scraper_rspec.rb` again. The test cases would success upon each file created :)


### Deployment
1) Git clone this repo and cd the to the `web_scraper` directory.
2) Run `ruby bin/main.rb`
3) Input either 'udacity', 'indeed', or 'remote.io'
4) Tada! 'udacity_courses.txt', 'indeed_jobs.txt', or 'remote_io.txt' would be created at the root directory respectively.
5) The default URLs for indeed.com and remote.io are catered for Ruby-on-Rails remote job opportunities. Feel free to change the default URL in `lib/scraper.rb` to suit your specifications. :)
